#### 1. Introduction to Python & Programming
**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

**Example:**
```python
# Simple Python program to print "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### 2. Strings (Basic)
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. They can be single (`'`), double (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).

**Example:**
```python
single_quote_string = 'Hello'
double_quote_string = "World"
triple_quote_string = '''Hello, World!'''
```

#### 3. Escape Sequence
Escape sequences are used to represent special characters within strings, such as newline (`\n`), tab (`\t`), or backslash (`\\`).

**Example:**
```python
new_line = "Hello\nWorld"
tabbed = "Hello\tWorld"
backslash = "Hello\\World"
print(new_line)
print(tabbed)
print(backslash)
```

#### 4. Arithmetic Operations
Python supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), integer division (`//`), modulus (`%`), and exponentiation (`**`).

**Example:**
```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # 13
print(a - b)  # 7
print(a * b)  # 30
print(a / b)  # 3.333...
print(a // b) # 3
print(a % b)  # 1
print(a ** b) # 1000
```

#### 5. Precedence and Associative Rule
Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed. Associativity defines the order in which operators of the same precedence are processed.

**Example:**
```python
result = 3 + 4 * 2  # Multiplication has higher precedence, result is 11
result = (3 + 4) * 2  # Parentheses change precedence, result is 14
result = 2 ** 3 ** 2  # Right-to-left associativity of exponentiation, result is 512
```

#### 6. Variables
Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.

**Example:**
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_student = True
```
